       " \"a great beach read i don't know about you but i would hate to have to go through high school again all the cliques and having to worry about trying to see if you could become popular makes me shudder to even think about it that's why i could never even think of applying for a job like taylor it's sad to say that i probably wouldn't last very long what i really liked about taylor is that even though she works in hollywood and has the untimely job of being a second assistant she's not ditzy she's really quite smart and knows about the actual movie industry even though she's not too knowledgeable about the hierarchy about moving up i really liked learning about scripts and background knowledge myself it makes the movie industry become more real when you know this stuff and not just like some magical wonderland taylor is also realistic and relatable this book does not having annoying slang thrown around by characters and there's not really that much name or label dropping it's funny seeing her battle wits with kylie with each trying to outdo and slam down the other although quinn appears to be of help to taylor it's also a testament to the lack of parenting that goes on in the industry i'm really not a fan of how teens can do all these things ruin people's lives and then get completely away with it the only qualm is that this is a storyline that has been done numerous times almost every chick flick that takes place in a magazine setting has done this plot therefore you know exactly what's going to happen however the story is so engaging and the plot is witty and funny that it really doesn't matter and you get sucked up into the the lives of the characters if you are looking for a great book to bring to the beach this is it it's a fun read that totally helps you to escape from the normal routines of daily life and brings you to the glamorous world of the rich famous and beautiful i wish this book was part of a series because i would love to learn more about taylor's life and the world of hollywood cliques highly recommended\",\n",
       " \"quick & fun summer read with some twists obviously the premise of this book first struck me as a knockoff of the devil wears prada i was pleasantly surprised however to discover that this was not another tale of assistants putting up with impossibly awful bosses rather taylor's boss was not the problem - she's the kind of classy lady you would want to work for - instead it was taylor's fellow assistant who turned out to be the complete psycho taylor's character wasn't wildly appealing but the story was funny fast-paced and truly captured the lives of many assistants i was interested i wanted taylor to prevail over her seemingly-insane roommate and her shallow judgemental co-workers - even when the story took some unrealistic turns i was rooting for taylor to win i definitely recommend this book as a quick and fun summer read\",\n",

       " 'excellent buy i did a lot of comparison shopping and decided to buy the rand mcnally 7\" gps has better graphics than cobra 7\" it does have lane assist which is important when in large metro areas and need to be in correct lane for exits etc atlanta ga i have read some of the negative comments written earlier and i do not have those problems sure sometimes it does not give the fastest or the simplest route but it has never sent me down a non truck route like all the prior gps i have had in the past i am a car carrier so i set truck size at 13\\' 8\" and it has kept me from going down roads with 13\\'6\" bridges the only negative comment i have is that it constantly changes map views from city to county to state way to often other than this i love the fact that 1) it shows mileage to destination arrival time (which you can change to time left) 2) shows the city county and state you are current located (how often we truck drivers pull over at a rest area or truck stop and wonder what city we are located) 3) large 7\" color screen for easy viewing and screen changes automatically for night time driving 4) list truck poi and non truck poi (wish rand mcnally had a feature that would let us send them an update for poi maybe when we get at a loves that use to be a pilot just tap on the screen and edit info then when i connect gps to computer for weekly update the map will get updated 5) able to update construction info by linking gps to computer and get updates given to rand mcnally by the states unfortunately like usual the states are mostly behind on updates given to rand mcnally this is where we the consumer should have the ability to tap screen and make corrections and send it to rand mcnally many times i have gone into areas that it said \"construction ahead\" and no construction is being done because it has been completed 6) speed limits of highways and interstates and shows your current speed just below it (also shows truck speed limits in red) still the states have to report these limits to rand mcnally and as usual they are slow on reporting but still most of the time 95% it is correct 7) great truckers tools like driving hours left it automatically changes to driving when truck has moved for more than 1 mile and changes to off duty if it is idle for 15 minutes it lets you know when you have 1 hour left to drive and that driving time has expired you reset every day manually also have total hours worked for day and hours left to work for the week you will have to manually override this sometimes because it doesn\\'t distinguish off duty and on duty hours well you have to manually tell it you are on duty i just manually configure at the end of the day the important one is driving hours and end of the week hours 8) service reminders for your perimeters you set such as 8000 and 16000 services you reset manually when completed 9) able to set many multiple stops set and ability to add more stops in route 10) loud enough to hear spoken text to speech street names over engine noise (and believe me my truck is loud) 11) ability to save your own poi (i do it all the time) 12) it tells you when you are 3 miles from approaching a weight station (you can configure it up to 5 miles) 13) it tells you when you are 1 mile from state border and tells you when you cross border and what state you are in 14) it tells you all mileage you driven that day and mileage by state and mileage by day saves info for 1 year overall this is definitely a truckers friend and i absolutely love this gps a definite must buy',\n",
